## Minor changes for the manufacture and a fprint change

I have modified the 6 in 6 out code to reflect some of the changes that Martin has made in his repository. I have not changed the switch case numbers as this would cause an issue for people following the original YouTube videos I have made.

In the next few weeks I will start to show some other examples for Servo control.
